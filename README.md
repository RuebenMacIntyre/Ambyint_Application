# Ambyint_Application
Reading sensor data

There are 4 executables. The AmbyintApplication.exe is the one to start. It will start up the others using a Windows form dialog.

I could not include the data file because it is too large for GitHub. The user will have to copy their version of the data file into the ‘Ambyint Assignment’ folder. The data file must be there for the application to work properly.
Because I am new to TCP Server and Client technology I did not include unit tests or design patterns because i did not have time to research these items.

The applications was developed on a Windows 10 machine.

Thanks for this opportunity, and let me know if you have any questions.
