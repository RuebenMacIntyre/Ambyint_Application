# Ambyint_Application
Reading sensor data

First, please ignore the Ambyint Assignment folder, it contains the older C# versions of the executables and source files.

There are 4 executables and associated C++ source files. Copy all of the executables to the same folder.  Add your copy of the data file to this folder. I could not include it because it was too large for GitHub.

AmbyintApplicationC++ is the executable to start. It is a C++ Windows Form application and will start the other C++ Win32 Console Applications when you click on the appropriate buttons on the form.

I did not include unit tests or design patterns because I am new to TCP/IP and I did not have time to research these items.

The applications was developed on a Windows 10 machine.

Thanks for this opportunity, and let me know if you have any questions.
