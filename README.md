# Ambyint_Application
Reading sensor data

First, please ignore the Ambyint Assignment folder, it contains the older C# versions of the executables and source files.

There are 4 executables all written in C++. I have included the C++ source files as well. Copy all of the executables to the same folder.  Add your data file containing the sensor data to the same folder. I could not include the data file because it is too large for GitHub. AmbyintApplicationC++ is the one to start. It will start up the others using a Windows form dialog.

I did not include unit tests or design patterns because I am new to TCP/IP and I did not have time to research these items.

The applications was developed on a Windows 10 machine.

Thanks for this opportunity, and let me know if you have any questions.
